**User requests:**
Create all needed code using all needed libraries for a Web3 application and a corresponding Telegram bot based on the following requirements. 

App Features:
User Authentication: Users must connect via Solana wallets (Phantom or Solflare).
Token Requirement: Users must hold at least 500,000 $GOREMU tokens in wallet 7TTcLchHbXz5fQqbBcoWi1Zen87AiziaqFCrf9Enpump to access the app.
Pump Creation: Users can create "pumps" that involve small buys and sells of one or more tokens for a designated duration.
Payment System: Each token pump for 10 minutes costs 50 $GOREMU, sent to wallet 34R39SG8j8HpAMde1jX9J6qvxzm9Pdp8t8DKD3PoGrdk. The cost increases proportionally based on the number of tokens and the pump duration.
Pump Configuration Options:
Token Selection: Users choose which tokens to pump.
Duration: Pump duration ranges from 5 minutes to 1 month, with predefined increments.
Buy/Sell Amounts: Users set the initial buy and sell amounts.
Stop-Loss/Take-Profit: Users can specify stop-loss and take-profit levels by percentage, $SOL amount, or USD value.
Transaction Frequency: Define how many transactions occur per minute.
Resource Limits: Users can limit the $SOL and token amounts used per pump.
Admin Features:
Admin access is granted when wallet 34R39SG8j8HpAMde1jX9J6qvxzm9Pdp8t8DKD3PoGrdk connects.
Admins can modify token requirements, fees, and other parameters via a dedicated UI.
Telegram Bot:
Integrate with the app for pump management.
Support Solana wallet authentication.
Allow users to create, view, and manage pumps directly from Telegram.
Provide webhook support for real-time updates and notifications.
Technical Specifications:
Use Solana-specific libraries like @solana/web3.js and @solana/spl-token for wallet and token interactions.
Ensure secure transaction handling, token balance checks, and fee transfers.
Include a user-friendly UI/UX for both pump creation and admin management.
Deliverables:
The AI should output a detailed step-by-step plan for building the app and bot, including:
User flows.
Solana commands needed for wallet and token interactions.
Key libraries or frameworks required for the app and bot.
Generate the exact text to configure the Telegram bot in BotFather, ensuring options for webhooks and commands.
Ensure the output is clear, detailed, and actionable for developers.
Only use valid code and valid Solana commands.  
Generate the exact code needed to copy and paste into Botfather for a corresponding telegram bot. 
Make all code immediately deployable on Solana testnet and give detailed instructions on how to do so.

## Project Plan

### Project Plan for Building the Web3 Application and Telegram Bot

#### **Project Overview**
The goal is to build a Web3 application and Telegram bot that allows users to create and manage token pumps on the Solana blockchain. The application will require users to hold a minimum amount of $GOREMU tokens to access features, and the Telegram bot will provide a seamless interface for managing pumps.

---

### **Main Tasks**

#### **1. Project Setup**
   - **Frontend**: Set up a React.js project.
   - **Backend**: Set up a Node.js project with Express.
   - **Telegram Bot**: Set up a Telegram bot using `node-telegram-bot-api`.
   - **Solana Integration**: Install and configure `@solana/web3.js` and `@solana/spl-token`.

#### **2. User Authentication**
   - **Task**: Implement wallet connection using Phantom or Solflare.
   - **Technical Considerations**:
     - Use `@solana/web3.js` to connect to the user's wallet.
     - Verify the wallet holds at least 500,000 $GOREMU tokens using `@solana/spl-token`.

#### **3. Pump Creation**
   - **Task**: Allow users to create pumps by selecting tokens, setting parameters, and paying fees.
   - **Technical Considerations**:
     - Use `@solana/web3.js` to handle buy/sell transactions.
     - Deduct 50 $GOREMU per 10 minutes from the user's wallet using `@solana/spl-token`.

#### **4. Admin Features**
   - **Task**: Build a UI for admins to modify token requirements, fees, and other parameters.
   - **Technical Considerations**:
     - Create a secure admin dashboard with role-based access control.
     - Use a database (e.g., MongoDB) to store admin settings.

#### **5. Telegram Bot Integration**
   - **Task**: Implement commands for wallet authentication, pump creation, and management.
   - **Technical Considerations**:
     - Use `node-telegram-bot-api` to handle bot interactions.
     - Implement webhooks for real-time updates and notifications.

#### **6. Testing**
   - **Task**: Test the application on the Solana testnet.
   - **Technical Considerations**:
     - Use the Solana CLI to airdrop test SOL and $GOREMU tokens.
     - Test wallet connection, token balance checks, and pump creation.

#### **7. Deployment**
   - **Task**: Deploy the frontend, backend, and Telegram bot.
   - **Technical Considerations**:
     - Frontend: Deploy using Vercel or Netlify.
     - Backend: Deploy using Heroku or AWS.
     - Telegram Bot: Host on a cloud server or use a serverless function.

---

### **Technical Considerations**

#### **Frontend (React.js)**
   - Use `@solana/web3.js` for wallet connection and token balance checks.
   - Implement a user-friendly interface for pump creation and management.
   - Ensure responsive design for both desktop and mobile.

#### **Backend (Node.js with Express)**
   - Use `@solana/web3.js` and `@solana/spl-token` for Solana interactions.
   - Implement API endpoints for wallet authentication, pump creation, and admin features.
   - Use a database (e.g., MongoDB) to store user and pump data.

#### **Telegram Bot**
   - Use `node-telegram-bot-api` for bot interactions.
   - Implement commands for wallet authentication, pump creation, and management.
   - Use webhooks for real-time updates and notifications.

#### **Solana Integration**
   - Use `@solana/web3.js` for wallet connection and transaction handling.
   - Use `@solana/spl-token` for token balance checks and transfers.
   - Test all Solana interactions on the testnet before deploying to mainnet.

#### **Security**
   - Implement role-based access control for admin features.
   - Use HTTPS for secure communication between the frontend, backend, and Telegram bot.
   - Validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
